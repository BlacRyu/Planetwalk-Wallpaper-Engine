- Add props to planets
- Add more characters
- Add some sort of interactive component(s)
	- Clicking on planet surface creates a prop there?
	- Clicking on sky creates a shooting star?
	- Clicking on a survivor makes them jump?
- Allow for multiple characters, or just an 'All survivors' option.


x Make planet texture swappable at runtime
x Add a class that will create an image layer which is parented to a transform at the center of the planet so that we can easily rotate the sprite around the planet's surface.

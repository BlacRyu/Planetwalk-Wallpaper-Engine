- Register all assets so they publish correctly.
- Add props to planets
- Add some sort of interactive component(s)
	- Clicking on planet surface creates a prop there?

x Make planet texture swappable at runtime
x Add a class that will create an image layer which is parented to a transform at the center of the planet so that we can easily rotate the sprite around the planet's surface.
x Add more characters
x Allow for multiple characters, or just an 'All survivors' option.
